# 🚢 Titanic - Predicting Survival with Machine Learning

Welcome aboard!  
This project is a hands-on machine learning exploration using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
It’s basically the “Hello, World!” of data science — and here I am, diving in.

---

## 🎯 What I'm Trying to Do

- Explore the dataset (EDA)
- Make sense of the features and do some feature engineering
- Train machine learning models (coming soon!)
- Create and submit predictions to Kaggle
- Learn and have fun while building my data science workflow

## 📈 Project Workflow

Here’s how I plan to approach the Titanic survival prediction:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understand the structure of the data  
   - Check for missing values and class imbalance  
   - Visualize feature relationships (e.g., survival vs. age, class, sex)

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features like "FamilySize", "Title", and "IsAlone"  
   - Handle missing values (e.g., Age, Fare)  
   - Encode categorical features

3. **Model Building**  
   - Try different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
   - Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation  
   - Compare model performance (accuracy, F1-score)

4. **Prediction & Submission**  
   - Select best model  
   - Generate predictions for test set  
   - Submit to Kaggle and evaluate result

5. **Future Plans**  
   - Try ensembling (voting, stacking)  
   - Use pipelines for cleaner workflow  
   - Document the whole process in scripts


## 🤓 Notes to Self

- Keep code clean and modular
- Try different models and compare results
- Don’t be afraid to mess up — it’s all part of the game
